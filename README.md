# genetic_alg
This is my very first genetic algorythm written in c++.
This program shows hows species aclimatizes to the new conditions due to the weather. They will change their value, if the best value to alive is higher or lower. This is a program, which uses fitness funtion, asexual reproduction and also mutation. It is connected to the Access database, and sql queries make tables and relationships. What is more, the database is connected to the Power Bi. It has some accurate graphs, and also shows how generations change.
The code is fully written in the c++ file. I used IDE - Visual Studio 2017.
Sooner or later, I will recreate my code to be Objective C++!
